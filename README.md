# Autolog 
Autolog is a service used to store information about the vehicles in your garage. Makes and models, as well as maintenance logs so that you can keep better track of the history of your vehicles. 

## Why?
Since I perform most of the work on my own cars, I am responsible for keeping the maintenance history. This is often a red flag to both future buyers of my cars, and any shop that has to perform maintance on the car in the future. In the past, home mechanics would keep a small notebook full of receipts in their glove compartment, serving as a log for services completed. This log, however, was easily lost, and would quite literally disentigrate over time. 

Autolog looks to fix this.
